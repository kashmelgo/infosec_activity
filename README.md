1. Laravel implements MVC (Model View Controller) architecture making it easier to maintain the web app because it separates the model, view and controller. In this case, the registration form uses the view for the html content to be displayed. The information that is inputted is handled by the respective controller that handles all the logic. Then it is then compared to the model which is the user and it is here where the information that is inputted is inserted.
2. Passwords are now encrypted so that when it is passed to the database, it will be more secured.
3. SQL queries aren't hardcoded but instead uses Laravel's eloquent which is good against SQL injections.
